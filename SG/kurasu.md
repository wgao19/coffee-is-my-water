# Kurasu

I sometimes spend a cozy afternoon reading with a cup of coffee at a shop called Kurasu. One time I was preparing for the itinerary of a Japan trip.
As coffee has been one constant topic on my exploration list, there was a book on the table called LiLo Coffee Roasters that caught my eye.
It was a self-answered question book about a mere three-year-old coffee shop in Osaka.
Turned out that their shop used to be a barbershop.
A salute to their spirit of exploration to switch to a new industry.
But I love more of their appreciation of life and beauty. LiLo in Veve is their motto.
That is an aesthetic convert from the phrase Love in Life.

I happened to transit in Osaka, so I decided to pay a visit.
It was a tiny place even in Singapore standard.
I meandered through their tiny hallway cautiously, a combined concern of the Japanese courtesy and making sure my 70L backpack was not breaking their cascade of brewing equipments.
Picking up one of their engraved stainless steel mug, I told the shop owner about my reading of their store from Kurasu in Singapore, and that that was what brought me here.
The owner was thrilled. It made my day, cuz I probably made his.
And my coffee now greets me everyday with this line that goes

> Life is short. Surround yourself with good people, and only drink good coffee.
