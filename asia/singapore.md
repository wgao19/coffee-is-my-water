### Review by @wgao19

❤️ Personal favorite in town 

This is the coffee outlet of the roaster [Papa Palheta](https://papapalheta.com/). The roaster store (sells coffee beans) is right beside. They have [another outlet at KL](https://papapalheta.com/pages/pulp-by-papa-palheta).

- They are serious about coffee
- Seasonal roasts based on origins
- Seasonal food menu are actually quite _good_

Recommendations

- Coffee
  - There is no bad coffee here.
  - **CASCARA** This is not coffee, but a drink made of dried coffee fruit. Light and cold and amazing.
- Food
  - Charred Cauliflower
